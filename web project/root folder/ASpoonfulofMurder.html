                            Introducing the three unlikeliest sleuths you'll ever meet…
                            
                            Every Thursday, three retired school teachers have their ‘coffee o’clock’ sessions at the Thirsk Garden Centre café.
                            
                            But one fateful week, as they are catching up with a slice of cake, they bump into their ex-colleague, Topsy.
                            
                            By the next Thursday, Topsy’s dead.
                            
                            The last thing Liz, Thelma and Pat imagined was that they would become involved in a murder.
                            
                            But they know there’s more to Topsy’s death than meets the eye – and it’s down to them to prove it…
                            
                            Sit down with a cup of tea and this perfectly witty, page-turning cosy crime novel. Fans of Agatha Christie, Death in Paradise and Midsomer Murders will be hooked from the very first page.
